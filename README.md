## Examining UK Deaths by Week

The data used in the notebook is from UK's [Office of National Statistics (ONS)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/weeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales).

### Summary:
This data includes registered deaths up to 27 Mar, 2020. ONS says that there is, on average, a 5 day lag between the date of actual death and the date a death is registered.

According to the figure below, it appears that London's overall deaths are rising above ususal, compared to the last 5 years.

It was not clear upon observation that deaths up to 27 Mar, 2020 were markedly higher than in the past 5 years in any other locations. Likewise for overall deaths in the UK and for deaths broken down by age.

I anticipate that this will change when ONS releases the next week of data (due 14 Apr, 2020).
